Each ability grants a Stance that empowers his next two basic attacks, and switching Stances will replace the empowered attacks from the previous Stance.
                        Periodically, after Udyr enters a Stance, he can cast it again at no cost after 0.25 seconds to Awaken it, refreshing the cooldown and empowering the Stance with an additional effect.
                        This effect is placed on cooldown at the start of the game.
